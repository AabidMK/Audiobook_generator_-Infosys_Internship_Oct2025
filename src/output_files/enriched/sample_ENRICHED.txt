 PAGE 1  AudioBook Generator 1. Introduction  Objective AudioBook Generator is a web application that allows users to upload one or more text documents PDF, DOCX, TXT and automatically converts them into highquality audiobooks. The application leverages Large Language Models LLMs to rewrite extracted text in an engaging, listenerfriendly audiobook style before using opensource Textto Speech TTS technology to produce downloadable audio files. This project enhances accessibility, productivity, and the enjoyment of written content. 2. Methodology  Workflow 1. User Uploads Documents o Users select and upload one or more documents through an interactive Streamlit web interface. 2. Text Extraction o The backend parses uploaded files and extracts text content  PDF PyPDF2 or pdfplumber  DOCX pythondocx  TXT Native file reading 3. LLMBased Text Enrichment o Extracted text is processed by a Large Language Model e.g., OpenAI API, Gemini API, or opensource LLM to rewrite the text for better narration and listener experience. O Example LLM prompts Rewrite this text for an engaging audiobook narration. 4. TexttoSpeech Conversion o The enriched text is fed into an opensource TTS library such as pyttsx3, Coqui TTS, or Tortoise TTS, producing a highquality .mp3 or .wav audio file. 5. Audio Download o The generated audio file is presented for immediate download within the Streamlit UI. 3. Modules  Document Upload Module Handles file uploads via Streamlit.  Text Extraction Module Extracts raw text from PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files.  LLM Enrichment Module Calls the LLM to rewrite and enhance extracted text.  TexttoSpeech Module Converts enriched text into audio using a TTS library.  Audio Delivery Module Provides the final audio file to the user for download.  PAGE 2  4. Weekwise Module Implementation and HighLevel Requirements Weeks 12  Set up environment and install dependencies.  Implement file upload and multiformat text extraction. Weeks 34  Integrate LLM for audiobookstyle text rewriting.  Build API connection between Streamlit and backend LLM processing. Weeks 56  Integrate and test opensource TTS conversion.  Ensure support for different voice options and error handling. Weeks 78  Finalize UIUX in Streamlit.  Conduct thorough testing, optimize performance, and complete documentation. 5. Evaluation Criteria  Milestone 1 Week 2 File upload and accurate text extraction operational.  Milestone 2 Week 4 LLMbased text rewriting working and demonstrably improving narration.  Milestone 3 Week 6 Audio file generation from rewritten text stable and highquality.  Milestone 4 Week 8 Full application workflowdocument upload to audio downloadoperational, user friendly, and documented.  PAGE 3  6. Design  Architectural Diagram 7.
