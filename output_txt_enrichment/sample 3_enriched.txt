The afternoon had descended unexpectedly, a stark contrast to the morning's earlier brightness. Now, a cold, wet greyness dominated, the sky the color of dull lead. Perhaps, had Sara Crewe been less imaginative, her world might have felt less lonely. But for a child so richly endowed with imagination, her profound isolation was an undeniable truth.

Her father, Captain Crewe, remained distant, serving in India, while Sara was consigned to Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls in London. The institution itself was a study in drabness – sprawling and uninspiring, much like its formidable headmistress. Every aspect of the place pressed down upon her, a weighty, unyielding reality, save for the vibrant dreams Sara meticulously crafted within her own mind.

To endure the pervasive monotony, Sara would consciously conjure new realities. She transformed her stark, cold attic room – with its single skylight offering only a glimpse of a wet, grey sky – into a magnificent Indian bungalow, brimming with plush, brightly colored cushions and exotic, enchanting lamps. Her thin, cold bed became, in her mind, an exquisite couch carved from sandalwood, and the rough, meagre blankets, luxurious silk and down. While this imaginative play was often a challenging endeavour, Sara was an exceptionally determined player, unwavering in her commitment to her inner world.
