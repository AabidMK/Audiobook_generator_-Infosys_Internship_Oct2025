               A Little Princess

It was a cold, wet afternoon, and the sky was the color of dull lead. It was an afternoon that had come up very unexpectedly, for the morning had been a gay and breezy one. If Sara Crewe had been a less imaginative person, she would have been a less lonely one, perhaps. But she was a very imaginative person, and there was no doubt about the loneliness.

Her father, Captain Crewe, was far away in India, and she was left in London at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls. The school was large and dull, and Miss Minchin was large and dull, and everything about the place was a dull, heavy fact, except the dreams Sara made up in her head.

She used to invent things to help her bear the dullness. She made believe that the attic room, which was bare and cold and had a skylight that only showed a wet, gray sky, was really a beautiful Indian bungalow, full of soft, bright cushions, and strange, lovely lamps. She tried to think of the cold, thin bed as a wonderful little couch, carved out of sandal-wood, and the scratchy, thin blankets as silk and down. It was a rather difficult game sometimes, but she was a very determined player.
