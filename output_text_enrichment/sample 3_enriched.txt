It was a cold, wet afternoon, and the sky was the color of dull lead. This day had arrived quite unexpectedly, for the morning had been gay and breezy. If Sara Crewe had been a less imaginative person, she might have been less lonely. But she was, indeed, a very imaginative person, and her loneliness was undeniable.

Her father, Captain Crewe, was far away in India, and she had been left in London at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls. The school was large and dull; Miss Minchin herself was large and dull. Everything about the place felt like a dull, heavy fact, except for the dreams Sara conjured in her mind.

To help endure the overwhelming dullness, she would invent things. She made believe that her attic room—bare, cold, with a skylight that revealed only a wet, gray sky—was actually a beautiful Indian bungalow, brimming with soft, bright cushions and strange, lovely lamps. She tried to envision the cold, thin bed as a wonderful little couch, carved from sandalwood, and the scratchy, thin blankets as luxurious silk and down. It was a rather difficult game at times, but Sara was a very determined player.
