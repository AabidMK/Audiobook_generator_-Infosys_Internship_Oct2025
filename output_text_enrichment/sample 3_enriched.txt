It was a raw, damp afternoon, the sky an oppressive, leaden gray. This bleakness had descended quite unexpectedly, for the morning had been bright and blustery. Perhaps if Sara Crewe had been less imaginative, she might have felt less lonely. But her vivid imagination, rather than a solace, often amplified the profound solitude she experienced.

Her father, Captain Crewe, was in distant India, leaving her entrusted to Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls in London. The school itself was imposing yet uninspiring, Miss Minchin equally drab and unremarkable; indeed, everything about the place felt like a stark, unyielding reality, save for the vibrant tapestry of dreams Sara wove within her mind.

She conjured worlds to endure the oppressive monotony. She would transform her sparse and chilly attic room, with its skylight revealing only a bleak, wet sky, into a lavish Indian bungalow, replete with plush, brightly colored cushions and exotic, enchanting lamps. She re-envisioned her meager, frigid cot as a wonderful little couch, intricately carved from fragrant sandalwood, and her coarse, threadbare blankets became sumptuous silk and down. It was a challenging mental exercise at times, yet she played with remarkable tenacity.
