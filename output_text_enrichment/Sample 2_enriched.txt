Introduction and Objective.
The Audiobook Generator is a web application designed to convert your text documents into high-quality audiobooks. Users can upload one or more files—in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats—and the application will automatically transform them. It achieves this by leveraging Large Language Models, or LLMs, to rewrite the extracted text into an engaging, listener-friendly "audiobook style." Following this, open-source Text-to-Speech technology is used to produce downloadable audio files. This project significantly enhances accessibility, boosts productivity, and enriches the enjoyment of written content.

Methodology and Workflow.
The process follows a clear five-step workflow:

First, **User Document Upload**. Users select and upload one or more documents directly through an interactive Streamlit web interface.

Second, **Text Extraction**. The backend then parses these uploaded files and extracts their text content. For PDF files, it utilizes libraries like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber. For DOCX files, it uses python-docx, and for TXT files, it employs native file reading.

Third, **LLM-Based Text Enrichment**. The extracted text is then processed by a Large Language Model—such as the OpenAI API, Gemini API, or an open-source LLM. This model rewrites the text to improve narration and enhance the listener's experience. A typical prompt might be: 'Rewrite this text for an engaging audiobook narration.'

Fourth, **Text-to-Speech Conversion**. The newly enriched text is then fed into an open-source Text-to-Speech library, like pyttsx3, Coqui TTS, or Tortoise TTS. This step produces a high-quality audio file, either in MP3 or WAV format.

Finally, **Audio Download**. The generated audio file is then presented to the user for immediate download directly within the Streamlit user interface.

System Modules.
The application is built upon five core modules:

*   The **Document Upload Module** manages file uploads through the Streamlit interface.
*   The **Text Extraction Module** extracts raw text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
*   The **LLM Enrichment Module** interfaces with the Large Language Model to rewrite and enhance the extracted text.
*   The **Text-to-Speech Module** converts this enriched text into audio using a Text-to-Speech library.
*   And finally, the **Audio Delivery Module** presents the finished audio file to the user for download.

Implementation Timeline and High-Level Requirements.
The project implementation is structured across four two-week phases:

**Weeks 1 and 2:** Focus on environment setup and dependency installation. This phase also includes implementing file upload and multi-format text extraction capabilities.

**Weeks 3 and 4:** Dedicated to integrating the Large Language Model for audiobook-style text rewriting. This involves building the API connection between Streamlit and the backend LLM processing.

**Weeks 5 and 6:** The goal here is to integrate and thoroughly test the open-source Text-to-Speech conversion. This also includes ensuring support for different voice options and robust error handling.

**Weeks 7 and 8:** The final phase involves finalizing the user interface and user experience within Streamlit, conducting thorough testing, optimizing performance, and completing all necessary documentation.

Evaluation Criteria.
Project success will be measured against four key milestones:

*   **Milestone 1, by Week 2:** File upload and accurate text extraction must be fully operational.
*   **Milestone 2, by Week 4:** LLM-based text rewriting should be working effectively and demonstrably improving narration quality.
*   **Milestone 3, by Week 6:** Audio file generation, from the rewritten text, needs to be stable and of high quality.
*   **Milestone 4, by Week 8:** The full application workflow—from document upload to audio download—must be operational, user-friendly, and comprehensively documented.

Architectural Design.

Technology Stack.
The core technologies powering this application include:

*   **Frontend:** Streamlit provides the user interface.
*   **Backend:** Optionally, FastAPI or Flask can be used for modularity or scalability.
*   **Text Extraction:** Libraries such as PyPDF2, pdfplumber, and python-docx handle text extraction.
*   **LLM Integration:** This utilizes the OpenAI API, Gemini API, or a local open-source Large Language Model.
*   **Text-to-Speech:** Open-source libraries like pyttsx3, Coqui TTS, Tortoise TTS, or gTTS are employed for audio conversion.
*   **Programming Language:** The entire application is developed using Python 3.x.
