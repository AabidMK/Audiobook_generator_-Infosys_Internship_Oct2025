Let's explore the AudioBook Generator, a powerful web application designed to transform your documents into high-quality audiobooks. Imagine simply uploading your PDF, DOCX, or TXT files and having them automatically converted into engaging audio.

How does it work? This application uses advanced Large Language Models, or LLMs, to first refine and rewrite your text into a captivating, listener-friendly audiobook style. After this crucial step, it employs open-source Text-to-Speech technology to generate the actual audio, ready for you to download. Ultimately, this project aims to boost accessibility, improve productivity, and significantly enhance how we enjoy written content.

Let's dive into the workflow of the AudioBook Generator. It all starts when you, the user, easily select and upload one or more documents through our interactive Streamlit web interface.

Next, our backend system gets to work, meticulously parsing your uploaded files to extract all the text content. For PDFs, it uses tools like PyPDF2 or pdfplumber. DOCX files are handled by python-docx, and for simple TXT files, it's a straightforward native file reading process.

This is where the magic happens: LLM-Based Text Enrichment. The extracted text is then sent to a Large Language Model—this could be something like the OpenAI API, Gemini API, or even a local open-source LLM. Its job is to rewrite and enhance the text, making it perfect for smooth narration and an excellent listening experience. A typical instruction given to the LLM might be, "Rewrite this text for an engaging audiobook narration."

Once the text is perfectly polished, it moves on to the Text-to-Speech Conversion stage. Here, the enriched text is fed into an open-source TTS library, such as pyttsx3, Coqui TTS, or Tortoise TTS. The result? A high-quality audio file, typically in MP3 or WAV format.

Finally, your brand-new audiobook is ready! The generated audio file is presented for immediate download right within the Streamlit user interface.

The AudioBook Generator is built upon several key modules, each with a specific role. First, we have the Document Upload Module, which, as its name suggests, manages all file uploads through Streamlit.

Then there's the Text Extraction Module, responsible for pulling out the raw text from your PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.

The LLM Enrichment Module is crucial; it interacts with the Large Language Model to rewrite and enhance the extracted text, optimizing it for narration.

Following that, the Text-to-Speech Module takes the enhanced text and transforms it into audio using a chosen TTS library.

And finally, the Audio Delivery Module ensures the finished audio file is conveniently made available for you to download.

Let's look at the implementation timeline and high-level requirements, broken down week by week. During Weeks one and two, the focus is on setting up the development environment, installing all necessary dependencies, and implementing the core file upload and multi-format text extraction functionalities.

Moving into Weeks three and four, the team integrates the Large Language Model for that critical audiobook-style text rewriting. This also includes building the API connection between the Streamlit frontend and the backend LLM processing.

Weeks five and six are dedicated to integrating and thoroughly testing the open-source Text-to-Speech conversion. During this phase, attention is also paid to supporting various voice options and robust error handling.

Finally, in Weeks seven and eight, the user interface and user experience within Streamlit are finalized. This period also involves comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and completing all necessary documentation.

To ensure the project stays on track, we've established clear evaluation criteria, tied to specific milestones. Milestone one, due by Week two, requires that file upload and accurate text extraction are fully operational.

Milestone two, by Week four, focuses on the LLM-based text rewriting being functional and clearly improving the narration quality.

By Week six, Milestone three dictates that audio file generation from the rewritten text must be stable and produce high-quality output.

And finally, Milestone four, expected by Week eight, signifies that the full application workflow—from document upload all the way to audio download—is operational, user-friendly, and completely documented.

Let's wrap up by looking at the core technology stack that powers this AudioBook Generator. For the frontend, we're utilizing Streamlit, known for its ability to create interactive web applications with ease.

On the backend, options include FastAPI or Flask, which can be used to add modularity or scale if needed.

For text extraction, key libraries include PyPDF2 and pdfplumber for PDFs, and python-docx for Word documents.

LLM integration can be achieved through services like the OpenAI API, Gemini API, or by using a local open-source LLM.

For the Text-to-Speech component, we have a choice of libraries such as pyttsx3, Coqui TTS, Tortoise TTS, or gTTS.

And unifying all these components is the programming language Python, specifically Python 3.x.
