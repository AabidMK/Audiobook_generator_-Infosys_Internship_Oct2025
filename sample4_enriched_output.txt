**Summary of Improvements:**

*   **Clarity:** Removed the confusing numbers (`4`, `7`), symbols (`?`, `~~`, `>`), and forced line breaks.
*   **Grammar:** Corrected the fragmented structure into complete, coherent sentences.
*   **Professionalism:** Used standard capitalization (sentence case or title case) instead of all caps, which can feel like shouting.
*   **Engagement:** Offered versions with stronger, more descriptive verbs ("ensure," "maintain," "improve") to make the statement more impactful.
