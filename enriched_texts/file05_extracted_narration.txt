Hello listeners, welcome! Today, we'll be going over some important details for an upcoming event, including the address, what to bring, and a crucial step for parents and guardians regarding a waiver.

First, let's talk about the location. The event will be held at **TopJump**, which is situated at **3735 Parkway**... in **Pigeon Forge, Tennessee**, with the postal code **37863**. For those familiar with the area, it's conveniently located right on the Parkway, near the Dixie Stampede.
