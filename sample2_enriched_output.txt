Of course. The best way to rewrite this depends on the context (e.g., an email, a presentation, a biography). Here are several options, categorized by their level of formality and intended use.

### **Option 1: Simple & Professional (Most Common)**

This is a direct, clear, and universally professional replacement.

> **"My name is Shruti Oberoi."**

**Why it's better:** It replaces the casual "Hi" with a more formal and complete sentence structure. It's perfect for emails, formal introductions, and documents.

### **Option 2: Modern & Approachable**

This version is professional yet slightly more conversational. It's great for networking, team introductions, and less formal business settings.

> **"I'm Shruti Oberoi."**

**Why it's better:** The contraction "I'm" is widely accepted in modern business communication. It feels friendly and confident without being overly casual.

### **Option 3: For Presentations or Public Speaking**

When addressing a group, it's effective to add a greeting.

> **"Hello, everyone. My name is Shruti Oberoi."**

or

> **"Good morning. For those who don't know me, I'm Shruti Oberoi."**

**Why it's better:** It engages the audience directly and sets a professional, confident tone for a speech or presentation.

### **Option 4: Adding Context (Highly Recommended)**

In most professional situations, your name is followed by your role or purpose. This is the most effective and engaging approach.

> **"My name is Shruti Oberoi, and I am the [Your Title] at [Your Company]."**

or

> **"I'm Shruti Oberoi, the new Project Manager for the marketing team. It's a pleasure to meet you all."**

**Why it's better:** It immediately provides value by telling the audience who you are and why you are introducing yourself. It’s more engaging and moves the conversation forward.
